# Axon Action Potential Propagation in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating the propagation of action potentials along an axon using the CRRSS model. The code models the behavior of voltage-gated ion channels in a neuron's membrane and simulates the propagation of action potentials in both bi-directional and uni-directional manners.

## Repository Contents

- `hw2.m`: The main script that sets up the initial parameters, runs the CRRSS model, and plots the results.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Action Potential Propagation**: This part involves developing a MATLAB program that simulates a propagating action potential along a 9 cm axon segment.

2. **Minimum Current Determination**: This part involves determining the minimum current needed to induce a bi-directional propagating action potential in the axon from various distances. It also includes the creation of a surface plot of Vm(x,t) and a movie of the propagating action potential.

3. **Unidirectional Action Potential Propagation**: This part involves generating a unidirectional propagating action potential in the axon using any combination of multiple anodes and cathodes as well as waveshapes and pulsewidths. It includes the creation of both a surface plot and a movie of the unidirectional action potential.

## Results

The results of the simulations are presented in the form of plots and movies. The movies show the propagation of action potentials along the axon over time.

## Usage

To run the simulations, clone this repository and run the `hw2.m` script in MATLAB.
